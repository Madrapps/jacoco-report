# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, we encourage to first discuss the change you wish to make via
an [issue](https://github.com/Madrapps/jacoco-report/issues) before
submitting a change. We're not strict about this and for small changes feel free to raise a PR directly.

## Pull Request Process

- Aim to keep PR scoped to one feature for ease of review.
- For new features or changed features, update the `README.md` accordingly.
- Allow the PR to be edited by maintainers.
- Use the default IDE code formatting settings.
